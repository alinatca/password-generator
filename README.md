# Password Generator
## Description

This password generator application allows users to generate a password by clicking a button and answering a series of prompts. The generated password will have a length of at least 10 characters, but no more than 64, and will include character types as specified by the user (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters).


## Getting Started
To use the password generator, simply click the "Generate Password" button and follow the prompts. You will be asked to specify the length of the password (between 10 and 64 characters) and which character types to include (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters). The password generator will validate each input and ensure that at least one character type is selected. Once all prompts have been answered, the password will be generated and displayed to the page.


## Psuedo Code

The user will receive prompts to input the lenght of the password: between 10-64 charachters long. The user will receive a series of prompts to confirm: password containing numbers, special, uppercase, lowercase characters. 4 variables for each character type for confirmation

It will need to randomly select array data, so Math.random and Math.floor will need to be used

The application will have to validate user input and ensure at least one character type is selected, the lenght is correct and it's a number. Using an if, else if statement or while

When all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. Displaying the generated password in an alert is acceptable, but attempt to write the password to the page instead.
